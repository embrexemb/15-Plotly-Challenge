# 15-Plotly-Challenge
Notes:
 
* conda environment is WorkingPython
* Assignment uses Plotly.js latest version and d3.js version 5
* use python -m http.service to run website locally
* use https://embrexemb.github.io/15-Plotly-Challenge/ to see website on GitPages
* The deployed website uses appchanged.js to show the charts - this is a refactored version of app.js - both versions work.
